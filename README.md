# Introduction to Python

## Review of Git Terminology

- In the last assignment, how did the class copy, your fork, and your local copy of the repository relate to each other?
- If you draw arrows connecting the copies, can you label these arrows with the git "verbs" - _fork_, _clone_, _push_, and _pull_ request?
- What's the difference between forking or cloning and branching?
- What are the two ways we can use the _checkout_ command?

## Reading

As a reminder, keeping up with reading in the Practical Computing book (and reviewing outside resources) provides valuable added perspective about the topics we are covering. For this week, please review chapters 7 and 8. Additional resources are linked below.

## What is Python?

- Interpreted, high-level language
- Very popular among computational biologists
- One of the most "human readable" programming languages
- One of the few languages where line indentation is actually interpreted as part of the code
- Python is _much_ less picky than bash about spacing within lines, though
- Dynamically typed (don't worry, we'll get to this later)

## Three Ways to Run Python

### Python Interpreter

- Unlike many programming languages (e.g., C++ and Java), Python can be executed interactively.
- To start the Python interpreter, simply open up a Terminal window and type `python`.
- Once the Python prompt (`>>>`) appears, type:
    - `a = 3`
    - `print(a)`
- What do you see?
- To exit the Python interpreter, type `quit()`.

### Command-line Python

- Now, put those same commands in a text file ending with a `.py` extension (e.g., `test.py`).
- At the bash command prompt, type `python test.py`.
- What do you see?
- The `.py` extension isn't required, but is conventional for Python code.

### Jupyter Notebooks

- Jupyter notebooks are a special type of file that allows formatted notes to be mixed with Python code.
- These notebooks can be run on SuperMike through OnDemand.
- To open a Jupyter notebook, go to the "Interactive Apps" menu at the top and select "Jupyter Notebook".
- A form will be displayed that asks for some information. For now, please use these options:
    - Account: "hpc_icbio01"
    - Queue: "single"
    - Number of hours: 1
    - Number of nodes: 1
- Note that these options will "charge" the account that I've set up for this class (hpc_icbio01). For the purposes of this class, there will never be a need to change the numer of nodes to more than 1. You may later need to increase the number of hours, but please only ask for as many hours as you will be actively working at a time. If you open a notebook during the time you've requested, you won't need to re-enter any of this information. If the time has expired, you will need to make another request for time.
- [OPTIONAL] If you end up wanting to work with Jupyter notebooks on your own computer, you can install it locally. Probably the most popular way to run Jupyter notebooks locally is by installing Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com).

## Basic Python Data Types

- Numbers
    - Note that, unlike bash, Python can handle _both_ integers and floating point (decimal) numbers.
    - Integers - `myInt = 10`
    - Floating point numbers (decimals) - `myFloat = 3.21312`
    - If running Python interactively, variable values can be seen just by typing the name of the variable - `myFloat`.
    - If running Python in a script, variable values can be printed by using the `print()` funtion - `print(myFloat)`.
    - Define myInt and myFloat as above. Now calculate `myInt / myFloat`. What type of number is the result?
    - Now try `float(myInt)` and `int(myFloat)`. What are the results? Look back at the values of `myInt` and `myFloat`. Have they changed?
    - Changing numbers from one type to another is one form of "type casting".

- Strings - `myStr = "This is a string."`
    - Strings can be of any length, but are always defined with quotes.
    - Individual characters, or subsets of characters, can be accessed using square brackets - []
      - String indices (and all indices in Python) start at 0
      - `myStr = "biology"`
      - `myStr[0]`
      - A range of indices can be defined with a colon
      - `myStr[2:5]`
      count the first number before the colon but does not include the second number
    - Strings can be concatenated together with the `+` operator.
      - `myStr = "biology"`
      - `newString = myStr + "_is_super_interesting"`
      - `newString`

- Booleans - `True` or `False`
    - These variables can take the values `True` or `False` only.
      - `myBool = True`
    - These are the data types used in things like `if...else` statements and `while` loops.
    - Logical statements, like `myNum > 3` or `myStr == "test"`, return a boolean variable indicating the result of the comparison
    - In Python, the value of a Boolean can be reversed by preceding it with `not`.
    an exclamation mark ! =not
    

## Functions

- Functions are the verbs of a programming language
- Functions take some variables or objects as input (arguments) and either do something with them or return a new variable/object.
- Functions are always written like this - `myFunction(object1,object2,...)`
- They _always_ have parentheses, even if they don't need any arguments to be passed to them
    - For example, `myFunction()`
- The number and type of arguments needed is specific to each function
- Perhaps the simples function to use is `print()`. `print()` can take an arbitrary number of variables as arguments and will print them to the screen.
- Here are a few other really useful functions and what they do:
    - `len(string)` - Takes one argument (a string) and returns its length
    - `abs(number)` - Takes one argument (either an integer or a float) and returns its absolute value
    - `round(float)` - Takes one floating point number as an argument and rounds it to the nearest integer
    - `type(variable)` - Takes one variable as an argument and returns its type


## Methods
  
- Methods are functions (sort of like actions or verbs) that belong to a variable
- Methods are accessed and used by appending them to the name of a variable, separated by a `.`
- For instance, let's say we define a string - `myStr = "biOLogy  "`. Here are some really useful methods that can be used with that string:
    - `myStr.upper()` - Converts all characters in the string to uppercase
    - `myStr.lower()` - Converts all characters in the string to lowercase
    - `myStr.strip()` - Removes whitespace from the beginning or ending of the string
    - Methods can also be chained! - `myStr.strip().lower()`
    - `myStr.replace("y","ical")` - This method functions like find and replace, where the first argument is the text to find and the second argument is the text to use when replacing.
    - `myStr.split("O")` - Breaks up the string, using the character provided as an argument as the delimiter. This method then returns a list of new strings. We'll talk more about lists later.

## Comments in Python

- Just like with bash, comments are essential in Python.
- Comments are included in Python by putting a `#` at the beginning of a line.
- Many text editors have a shortcut keystroke to toggle lines between being commented and uncommented. 
- `# This is an example of a comment`
